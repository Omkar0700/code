          <h5 class="mt-0">Devops</h5>
          By definition, DevOps outlines a software development process and an organizational culture shift that speeds the delivery of higher quality software by automating and integrating the efforts of development and IT operations teams – two groups that traditionally practiced separately from each other, or in silos.
          In practice, the best DevOps processes and cultures extend beyond development and operations to incorporate inputs from all application stakeholders - including platform and infrastructure engineering, security, compliance, governance, risk management, line-of-business, end-users and customers - into the software development lifecycle.

              <h5 class="mt-0">Docker</h5>
              <p>Docker is an open source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update and manage containers—standardized, executable components that combine application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.
                Containers simplify development and delivery of distributed applications. They have become increasingly popular as organizations shift to cloud-native development and hybrid multicloud environments. It’s possible for developers to create containers without Docker, by working directly with capabilities built into Linux and other operating systems.

                <h5 class="mt-0">Kubernetes</h5>
                <p>Kubernetes was first developed by engineers at Google before being open sourced in 2014. It is a descendant of Borg, a container orchestration platform used internally at Google. Kubernetes is Greek for helmsman or pilot, hence the helm in the Kubernetes logo (link resides outside IBM).
                    Today, Kubernetes and the broader container ecosystem are maturing into a general-purpose computing platform and ecosystem that rivals — if not surpasses — virtual machines (VMs) as the basic building blocks of modern cloud infrastructure and applications. This ecosystem enables organizations to deliver a high-productivity Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that addresses multiple infrastructure-related and operations-related tasks and issues surrounding cloud-native development so that development teams can focus solely on coding and innovation.</p>
